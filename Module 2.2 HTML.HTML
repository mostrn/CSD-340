    <h2>Chapter 1: Beginnings and Background</h2>

    <!-- Paragraph 1 with class "intro" -->
    <p class="intro">
      I grew up in a small town where everyone knew each other, which made community events a big part of my life. 
      Weekend gatherings at local parks and school activities were a constant source of connection and fun. 
      <span class="sentence">Those early experiences taught me the value of collaboration and showing up for others.</span>
    </p>

    <!-- Paragraph 2 -->
    <p>
      My childhood was filled with curiosity—taking things apart just to see how they worked and putting them back together again. 
      That tinkering mindset eventually led me toward technology and problem-solving. 
      I’ve always loved the feeling of figuring something out after a few failed attempts.
    </p>

    <!-- Paragraph 3 -->
    <p>
      Outside of school and work, I enjoy hobbies that balance creativity and focus. 
      I like hiking new trails, experimenting with simple cooking recipes, and learning small productivity techniques. 
      Little improvements over time add up and keep life interesting.
    </p>

    <!-- Paragraph 4 -->
    <p>
      My family has been a steady source of encouragement, reminding me to keep learning and to be patient with the process. 
      We share plenty of stories—some about successes, many about missteps that turned into lessons. 
      Their support helps me approach challenges with optimism.
